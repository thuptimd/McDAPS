# McDAPS
We introduce McDAPS, an interactive software for assessing autonomic imbalance from non-invasive multi-channel physiological recordings.  McDAPS provides a graphical user interface for data visualization, beat-to-beat processing and interactive analyses.  The software extracts beat-to-beat RR interval (RRI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the pulse amplitude of photoplethysmogram (PPGa) and the pulse-to-pulse interval (PPI).  The analysis modules include stationary and time-varying power spectral analyses, moving-correlation analysis and univariate analyses.  Analyses can also be performed in batch mode if multiple datasets have to be processed in the same way.  The program exports results in standard CSV format. 
McDAPS runs in MATLAB, and is supported on MS Windows and MAC OS systems.
